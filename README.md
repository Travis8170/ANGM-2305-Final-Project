## Challenges/ Future Improvements
There were a lot of challenges I had to face while working
on this project. It took a lot of researching for me to really
understand and wrap my head around how Classes and Methods worked.
I took heavy inspiration from the code that was given in our
rain lab to make this project possible. I also struggled a lot
on making the collision work in this project, but I solved it
by checking the coordinates of each pixel, and if they were
the same then they would be considered as colliding. Making
it a grid based system helped a lot in that regard. Unfortunately,
I didn't get to implment everything that I wanted to, such as
the menus or scoreboard system to display. However, I think
if I had another week I could get it done. I would probably
have to research other third party libraries as well. Overall,
I am happy with how the project turned out and I hope you think
it was a good attempt!
